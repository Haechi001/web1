<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<a href="https://www.ethereum.org" target="_blank" title="Ethereum Official Site">Ethereum</a> is <strong>a <u>decentralized platform</u> that runs smart contracts</strong>: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.

<p>1. Design and issue your own cryptocurrency</p>
<p>Create a tradeable digital token that can be used as a currency, a representation of an asset, a virtual share, a proof of membership or anything at all. These tokens use a standard coin API so your contract will be automatically compatible with any wallet, other contract or exchange also using this standard.</p>
<p>The total amount of tokens in circulation can be set to a simple fixed amount or fluctuate based on any programmed ruleset.</p>
<p>2. Kickstart a project with a trustless crowdsale</p>
<p>Do you already have ideas that you want to develop on Ethereum? Maybe you need help and some funds to bring them to life, but who would lend money to someone they donâ€™t trust?</p>
<p>Using Ethereum, you can create a contract that will hold a contributor's money until any given date or goal is reached. Depending on the outcome, the funds will either be released to the project owners or safely returned back to the contributors. All of this is possible without requiring a centralized arbitrator, clearinghouse or having to trust anyone.</p>
<p>You can even use the token you created earlier to keep track of the distribution of rewards.</p>
