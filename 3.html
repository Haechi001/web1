<h2>Ripple</h2>
<strong>Built for enterprise</strong> use, <a href="https://ripple.com/xrp/" target="_blank" title="Ripple Overview">XRP</a> offers banks and payment
providers a reliable, on-demand option to source
liquidity for cross-border payments.<br><br><br>

<p>1. Instant and Certain Settlement</p>
<p>xCurrent is Rippleâ€™s enterprise software solution that enables banks to instantly settle cross-border payments with end-to-end tracking. Using xCurrent, banks message each other in real-time to confirm payment details prior to initiating the transaction and to confirm delivery once it settles. It includes a Rulebook developed in partnership with the RippleNet Committee that ensures operational consistency and legal clarity for every transaction.</p>

<p>2. Low-Cost Liquidity</p>

<p>xRapid is for payment providers and other financial institutions who want to minimize liquidity costs while improving their customer experience. Because payments into emerging markets often require pre-funded local currency accounts around the world, liquidity costs are high. xRapid dramatically lowers the capital requirements for liquidity.</p>
