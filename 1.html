<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/how-it-works" target="_blank" title="How does Bitcoin work?">Bitcoin</a>(BTC) is <strong>a <u>cryptocurrency</u></strong>, a form of electronic cash.<br><br><br>

1. Decentralization

<p>Bitcoin's most important characteristic is that it is decentralized. No single institution controls the bitcoin network. It is maintained by a group of volunteer coders, and run by an open network of dedicated computers spread around the world. This attracts individuals and groups that are uncomfortable with the control that banks or government institutions have over their money.</p>
<p>Bitcoin solves the "double spending problem" of electronic currencies (in which digital assets can easily be copied and re-used) through an ingenious combination of cryptography and economic incentives. In electronic fiat currencies, this function is fulfilled by banks, which gives them control over the traditional system. With bitcoin, the integrity of the transactions is maintained by a distributed and open network, owned by no-one.</p>

2. Limited supply

<p>Fiat currencies (dollars, euros, yen, etc.) have an unlimited supply: central banks can issue as many as they want, and can attempt to manipulate a currency's value relative to others. Holders of the currency (and especially citizens with little alternative) bear the cost.</p>

<p>With bitcoin, on the other hand, the supply is tightly controlled by the underlying algorithm. A small number of new bitcoins trickle out every hour, and will continue to do so at a diminishing rate until a maximum of 21 million has been reached. This makes bitcoin more attractive as an asset: in theory, if demand grows and the supply remains the same, the value will increase.</p>
